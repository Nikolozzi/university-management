This project is my very first introduction to JavaServer Pages, Servlets and JDBC. 
I used Udemy's JSP/Servlets course as a primary reference material. It is a fairly simple university management application allowing
you to register a new student, subject, and each student on each subject. The project serves educational purposes and was not intended to be
used in a real-world application.
